## Script

Hey, this is Roger from Thinkful. In this video, I am going to demonstrate some basic commands that will allow you to interact with your computer via a command line.

Explain:
1. The terms Terminal, Shell, Prompt, and command line can all be used interchangeably. Whereas there is some nuance difference between them it is not something that is within the context of this lesson.
2. When first learning how to utilize the command line it can seem a bit scary but as you practice more with it you will find it is a very powerful tool to have in your developer toolkit.
3. Explain the structure of a command:
   * `$ command argument`
4. Demonstrate this structure with the `echo` command:

```sh
echo hello world!
```

5. Demo the `pwd` command
   * Be sure to open your finder and show them how the `pwd` command correlates to your file system

```sh
pwd
```

6. Demo the `ls` command

```sh
ls
```

7. Demo the `mkdir` command
   * Explain that dir is short for directory and a directory is just another name for a folder

```sh
mkdir my-first-directory
```

8. Demo the `cd` command

```sh
cd my-first-directory
```

9.  Demo the `touch` command
```sh
touch file.txt
```

Close out the video.
