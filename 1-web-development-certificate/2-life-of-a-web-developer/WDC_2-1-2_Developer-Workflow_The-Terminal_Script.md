## Script

Hey, this is Roger from Thinkful. In this video, we will talk briefly about what a terminal is and what they are capable of doing.

1. Explain what a terminal is:
   * They were a type of computer that we used before the invention of GUIs
     * They only allowed users to interact with a computer by providing it written commands
   * Explain what a GUI is
2. Explain that the terminals we interact with today are programs that mimic the behaviors of old terminal computers
3. Explain that even though we are going to briefly look at a terminal in a Mac OS the same concepts apply to Windows and Linux.
4. The terminal program allows you to perform behaviors such are creating and deleting files or folders
   * They can also allow you to open programs on your computer
   * Basically any command you can provide a GUI you can do via the terminal
5. Close out
