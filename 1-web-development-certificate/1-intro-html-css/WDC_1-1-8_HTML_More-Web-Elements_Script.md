## Script

Hey, this is Roger from Thinkful. In this video, we will learn ...

1. Explain what a `Pseudo-classes` is
   * `Pseudo-classes` - allow you to make changes to an element based on a specific state it enters.
     * For example if you wanted to change the color of a word when a user hovers over it, this would be an opportune time to utilize a `pseudo-class`
   * So the following code in action as you explain this:
```html
<a href="www.google.com" target="_blank">Google.com</a>
```

```css
a:hover   { color: green; }
```

2. Explain that there are many different types of Pseudo-classes that can be used on all types of HTML elements but in this video we are going to focus on 4 in particular that help us work with anchor tags.
   1. link pseudo-classes
   2. visited pseudo-classes
   3. hover pseudo-classes
   4. active pseudo-classes
3. Explain and demo the `a:link pseudo-classes`
   * Start by explaining what it does
   * Then explain how pseudo-classes are structured
     * They are appended to CSS selectors
     * You **must use** the `:` syntax
4. Explain and demo the `a:visited pseudo-classes`
5. Explain and demo the `a:hover pseudo-classes`
6. Explain and demo the `a:active pseudo-classes`
